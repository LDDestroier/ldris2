# LDRIS version 2
Modern multiplayer tetris for ComputerCraft. (Work in progress)

### Current features:
	+ SRS rotation and wall-kicking
	+ 7-bag randomization
	+ Modern-feeling controls
	+ Ghost piece
	+ Piece holding
	+ Sonic drop
	+ Configurable SDF, DAS, ARR, ARE, lock delay

### To-do:
	+ Refactor all code to look prettier
  + Refactor control functions
	+ Add score, and let lineclears and piece dropping add to it
	+ Fix garbage calculation when considering combos (currently doesn't factor in combos)
	+ Implement initial hold and initial rotation
	+ Check for perfect clears and react accordingly (send 10 lines of garbage)
	+ Add an actual menu, and not the crap that LDRIS 1 had
	+ Implement proper Multiplayer (aiming for modem-only for now)
  + Implement arcade features (proper kiosk mode, krist integration)
  + Add touchscreen-friendly controls for CraftOS-PC Mobile
	+ Cheese race mode
	+ Define color palletes so that the ghost piece isn't the color of dirt
	+ Add in-game menu for changing controls (some people can actually tolerate guideline)
