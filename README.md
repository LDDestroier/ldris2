- Add score, and let line clears and piece dropping add to it
- Implement initial hold and initial rotation

- Implement proper Multiplayer (aiming for modem-only for now)
- Implement arcade features (proper kiosk mode, krist integration)

- Add in-game menu for changing controls (some people can actually tolerate guideline)
