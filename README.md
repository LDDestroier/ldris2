# LDRIS version 2
Modern (to-be) multiplayer tetris for ComputerCraft. (Work in progress)

### Current features:
- SRS rotation and wall-kicking
- 7-bag randomization
- Modern-feeling controls
- Garbage attack support
- Ghost piece
- Piece holding
- Sonic drop
- Configurable SDF, DAS, ARR, ARE, lock delay
- Animated piece queue

### To-do:
- Figure out why the game randomly starts to lag badly in CraftOS-PC
- Refactor code to look prettier
- Find out why the minos don't instantly move up when board is almost full, and instead take one game frame to do so
- Add score, and let line clears and piece dropping add to it
- Implement initial hold and initial rotation
- Add an actual menu, and not the crap that LDRIS 1 had
- Implement proper Multiplayer (aiming for modem-only for now)
- Implement arcade features (proper kiosk mode, krist integration)
- Add touchscreen-friendly controls for CraftOS-PC Mobile
- Cheese race mode
- Add in-game menu for changing controls (some people can actually tolerate guideline)
